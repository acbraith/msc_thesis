# Stochasticity in the Travelling Salesman Problem

This project was based around analysis of stochastic edge costs in the TSP. The code here was used to scrape Google Maps data, fit Gaussian Process models to that data and perform some planning and analysis in variations of the TSP.

The code is a bit of a mess, but there are some potentially useful bits around if you look hard enough.
